# Vegan Meal Planner
## Vegan Meal Planning application created for Code Louisville Full-stack JavaScript Track

I created a vegan meal planner where you can add meal information (including categories for Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen), update meal information, and delete meals. You can also view the full week or each day individually.

This project uses the MEAN stack, with Pug templating and jQuery being used for the front-end framework. I used Bootstrap 4 and custom CSS for the layout and responsive design.

I would like to make future changes regarding redirecting to the last page you were on, adding login/sign up and user accounts, and overall design to improve usability.
